Props drilling is the process of passing data (props) from a parent component to a deeply nested child component through multiple intermediary components, even if those intermediaries donâ€™t need the data themselves. This can make the code harder to maintain and less efficient.

To avoid props drilling, techniques like Context API, Redux, or useReducer can be used.
